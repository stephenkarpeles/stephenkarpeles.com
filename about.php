          <p><span class="small-caps">I grew up</span> in and around Chicago, and received my Bachelor's Degree in Marketing from the University of Iowa. <span class="headshot"></span>After graduating in 2007, I joined a local Chicago startup called <a class="body-link" href="http://www.meetingtomorrow.com/" target="_blank">Meeting Tomorrow</a>. It was there that my marketing and design skills began to intersect, as I created "Quick Start Guides" for their audio visual products, managed their company website, and optimized every detail of the customer experience.</p>
          <p>Then in 2009, I got married and moved out to Phoenix, Arizona with my wife. Though the desert heat was a stark contrast from Chicago (our first day there it said 117&deg;F on our car thermometer!), we managed to survive&#9786; While there, I was brought on at <a class="body-link" href="http://www.phoenix.edu/" target="_blank">University of Phoenix</a> to help migrate their existing content to a new website. Once the site went live, I continued to update, publish, and enhance the school's content for their clients.</p>

          <p>I then returned to Chicago in 2010 and went back to work at Meeting Tomorrow. It was during that time&mdash;around fall 2010-ish&mdash;that I asked a coworker how to write CSS on top of HTML. Once he showed me the basics, I was off to the races...</p>
          <p>Ever since, I've been incorporating my marketing background into the design and development of websites. I've built corporate sites, educational sites, microsites, blogs, and a host of other web applications. If I had to say, my style could best be described as "corporate, clean, and colorful."</p>
          <p>Now, I currently work as the CEO and Founder of Salt.&mdash;a strategic marketing and digital design firm based in Chicago. I lead our marketing, design, and development work, and manage our day-to-day operations.</p> 
          <p>Deep down, my passion is to truly understand the needs and wants of users, in order to deliver them the best online experience possible.</p>
