          <h3>Who I Am</h3>
          <p class="bot-mar-large">I'm a husband, father, marketer, and designer. I've got a marketer's heart with the technical chops of a web designer. Sort of like a teddy bear with the hands of a neurosurgeon. In short, I strategize, design, and build websites from the ground up&mdash;fully aimed at delighting the user.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-col bp3-col-one-third">
          <h3>What I Do</h3>
          <p class="bot-mar-large">I research, write, plan, design, and code. (Plus drink a few cups of Earl Grey in between.) My favorite languages are HTML, CSS, jQuery/JavaScript, and PHP&mdash;and my weapons of choice are Photoshop, Sublime Text, WordPress, and clicky pens on scratch paper.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-col bp3-col-one-third">
          <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
          <p class="bot-mar-large">A poorly made website will hurt your brand. So will a thoughtless marketing strategy. You need both a deep empathy for the people who use your goods and services, and a helpful website that gets them what they need. I bring both of these together under one big, happy, user-centric roof.</p>
